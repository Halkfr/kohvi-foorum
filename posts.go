// var comment2_1 string = "Howdy Cowboy with a loyal pup by his side, thanks for sharing your story about Buster! It's always heartwarming to hear about the special bond between a cowboy and his trusty dog. I couldn't agree more that sheep dogs are a valuable asset on the range. They're not only great at herding, but they also provide companionship and security. Here's to many more happy trails with Buster by your side!"
// var comment2_2 string = "Howdy partner, your story about Buster reminded me of my own loyal sheep dog, Rusty. He may not be the biggest or the fastest either, but he's got a nose for finding lost livestock and a bark that can be heard for miles. It's great to see other cowboys and cowgirls appreciate the value of having a sheep dog on the range. Keep up the good work, and give Buster a pat on the head for me!"

var post3 string = `Hey everyone,

I've got to admit, I've been feeling a bit jittery about something lately. It's about the safety of using a Moka Pot. There's so much info out there, and it's making me a tad anxious.

Has anyone else felt this way? Are there genuine risks involved, or is it just overthinking? I could really use some reassurance or advice on this. Let's talk it out! â˜•ðŸ¤”`

// var comment3_1 string = "Howdy, folks! As a cowboy and a lover of photography, I reckon there ain't nothin' quite like capturing the thrill and excitement of a rodeo. I use an old Nikon F2 camera, and while it may not be as fancy as some of them newfangled models, it gets the job done just fine. There's somethin' about the way the film captures the grit and raw energy of the bulls and the cowboys that digital just can't match. So grab your gear and join me in the arena for some good old-fashioned rodeo photography!"

// I'm a cowgirl on the lookout for a cowboy who can ride, rope, and wrangle with the best of them. Someone who knows the ins and outs of ranch life and can appreciate a hard day's work.

// Now, I'm not just looking for any old cowboy. I want someone who's got a good head on their shoulders, a kind heart, and a strong work ethic. Someone who's not afraid to get their hands dirty and who knows how to treat a lady right.

// So if you think you fit the bill, send me a message and let's see if we can hit it off. Bonus points if you know how to two-step and don't mind a little dirt on your boots.

// Looking forward to hearing from you,
// Cowgirl on the lookout.`

// var comment4_2 string = "Howdy ma'am, your post caught my eye. I reckon I fit the bill of the cowboy you're looking for. I've been riding, roping, and wrangling since I was knee-high to a grasshopper, and I know how to treat a lady right. I'd love to two-step with you and show you what a real cowboy can do. Let me know if you're interested."
