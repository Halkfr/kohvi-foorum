// var comment2_1 string = "Howdy Cowboy with a loyal pup by his side, thanks for sharing your story about Buster! It's always heartwarming to hear about the special bond between a cowboy and his trusty dog. I couldn't agree more that sheep dogs are a valuable asset on the range. They're not only great at herding, but they also provide companionship and security. Here's to many more happy trails with Buster by your side!"
// var comment2_2 string = "Howdy partner, your story about Buster reminded me of my own loyal sheep dog, Rusty. He may not be the biggest or the fastest either, but he's got a nose for finding lost livestock and a bark that can be heard for miles. It's great to see other cowboys and cowgirls appreciate the value of having a sheep dog on the range. Keep up the good work, and give Buster a pat on the head for me!"
